# Metrics

A /metrics endpoint is a URL endpoint that exposes operational metrics and monitoring data for a web application. It typically returns a standardized format of metrics data, such as in the form of JSON or plaintext.

The value of a /metrics endpoint for a web application is that it provides insights into the performance and health of the application. It allows developers, system administrators, and other stakeholders to monitor and track key performance indicators (KPIs) related to the application's usage, behavior, and resource consumption.

Some examples of metrics that a /metrics endpoint might expose include:

- Request counts and response times: These metrics can provide insights into how many requests the application is handling, how quickly it is responding to them, and whether there are any issues with latency or performance.

- Error rates: This metric can help identify issues with the application, such as server errors, timeouts, or other problems that might be affecting the user experience.

- CPU and memory usage: These metrics can help identify whether the application is experiencing any resource constraints or performance issues that could affect its stability or reliability.

- Cache hit rates: This metric can provide insights into how often the application is able to serve requests from its cache, which can help identify potential opportunities for optimization or tuning.

Overall, a /metrics endpoint provides valuable insights into the inner workings of a web application, allowing developers and administrators to more effectively monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize the application's performance and reliability.

## Prometheus

### Introduction

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system that is widely used in the DevOps and cloud computing communities. The value of Prometheus lies in its ability to provide powerful and flexible monitoring capabilities for cloud-native applications, microservices architectures, and other distributed systems.

Some of the key benefits and value propositions of Prometheus are:

- Scalability: Prometheus is designed to handle large-scale, highly dynamic environments, with support for horizontally scaling across multiple instances and federating metrics across different systems and clusters.

- Time-series data: Prometheus is optimized for collecting and querying time-series data, which is critical for monitoring and troubleshooting modern distributed systems that generate vast amounts of metrics over time.

- Flexibility: Prometheus supports a wide range of metrics formats, including the popular Prometheus format and other industry-standard formats like OpenMetrics and Graphite.

- Query language: Prometheus comes with a powerful query language called PromQL, which allows users to slice and dice metrics data in real-time and build complex queries and aggregations.

- Alerting: Prometheus includes a built-in alerting system that allows users to define rules and conditions for triggering alerts based on specific metrics and thresholds.

- Integrations: Prometheus integrates with a wide range of other tools and systems, including Grafana for data visualization, Kubernetes for container orchestration, and many other popular DevOps tools.

Overall, the value of Prometheus lies in its ability to provide a flexible, scalable, and powerful monitoring and alerting solution that can help DevOps teams and other stakeholders to gain deep insights into the performance and health of their applications and infrastructure, enabling them to proactively identify and resolve issues before they become critical.

### Veloxide and Prometheus

Veloxide exposes a /metrics endpoint by default, which the Prometheus instance spun up by docker compose will scrape by default.

## Grafana

### Introduction to Grafana

Grafana is a popular open-source data visualization and monitoring tool that provides a wide range of benefits and value propositions for users. Here are some of the key benefits of using Grafana:

- Data Visualization: Grafana provides a flexible and intuitive interface for creating and customizing data visualizations, allowing users to easily create charts, graphs, dashboards, and other visualizations that can help them gain insights into their data.

- Integrations: Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including popular databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server, as well as cloud services like AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. This makes it easy for users to pull data from multiple sources and create unified dashboards and visualizations.

- Dashboard Sharing and Collaboration: Grafana allows users to easily share and collaborate on dashboards with other users, either within the organization or with external stakeholders. This can help teams to work more effectively together and ensure that everyone has access to the same data and insights.

- Alerting and Notifications: Grafana includes a built-in alerting system that allows users to set up alerts based on specific metrics or thresholds, and receive notifications via email, Slack, or other channels when those alerts are triggered. This can help teams to quickly identify and respond to issues before they become critical.

- Extensibility: Grafana is highly extensible, with a robust plugin architecture that allows users to add new features and functionality to the platform. This makes it possible to customize Grafana to meet specific business requirements and use cases.

Overall, Grafana provides a powerful and flexible platform for data visualization and monitoring, allowing users to gain deep insights into their data, collaborate effectively with others, and quickly identify and respond to issues as they arise.

### Veloxide and Grafana

The Grafana instance spun up by docker compose is configured to use Prometheus as a datasource, which in turn collects the metrics from /metrics. The Grafana instance is configured to use the Prometheus datasource by default. At the time of writing, there are no dashboards configured by default, but you can create your own however.
