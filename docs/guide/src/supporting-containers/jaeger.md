## Introduction to Jaeger

Jaeger, pronounced "yay-ger", is an open-source distributed tracing tool originally developed by Uber. It is designed to help developers troubleshoot and monitor complex distributed systems by providing visibility into the interactions between different components and services. Jaeger collects, analyzes, and visualizes tracing data to provide a comprehensive picture of the system's performance, latency, and error rates. With Jaeger, developers can easily trace requests across different services, identify bottlenecks, and optimize the system for better performance. Jaeger supports multiple languages and platforms and various tracing data formats, making it an ideal tracing tool for modern, cloud-native applications. Additionally, Jaeger provides advanced features such as distributed tracing and root cause analysis, making it suitable for identifying performance bottlenecks and other issues across complex, distributed systems. It also has a highly scalable architecture that can handle large volumes of tracing data, and integrates with other observability tools such as Prometheus and Grafana to provide a comprehensive observability solution. Sending traces to Jaeger is a powerful way to gain deep visibility into the behavior and performance of a system, making it an excellent choice for observability instrumentation.

## Veloxide and Jaeger

Veloxide is pre-configured to create traces automatically and send them to Jaeger.
