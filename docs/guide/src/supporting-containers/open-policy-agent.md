# Open Policy Agent

## Introduction to Open Policy Agent

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open-source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across the stack. It's commonly used to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more. Here are some key benefits of using OPA:

- Unified Policy Management: By using OPA, organizations can implement and manage policies across various parts of their system centrally. This unified approach simplifies the enforcement and management of security, compliance, and operational requirements.

- Flexibility: OPA allows for the expression of custom policies using a high-level declarative language called Rego. This makes it possible to tailor policies to fit the specific needs and constraints of a particular environment or application.

- Performance: OPA has been designed to be lightweight and fast. Policies are evaluated locally on the machine where the request is being handled, minimizing latency and the need for remote calls.

- Integration: OPA provides a set of APIs that enable seamless integration with various systems and tools. Whether it's Kubernetes, Terraform, or a custom application, OPA can likely be integrated to enforce policies within that context.

- Decoupling Policy from Code: By handling policies outside of the application code, OPA allows developers to focus on writing application logic without having to concern themselves with policy enforcement. This separation of concerns can lead to more maintainable and understandable code.

- Rich Tooling and Community Support: As an open-source project, OPA benefits from a strong community of users and contributors. There are a plethora of tools, libraries, and extensions available that make working with OPA easier and more effective.

- Real-time Policy Evaluation: OPA enables real-time policy evaluation, ensuring that decisions are made based on the most current policy definitions and data. This is vital for environments where policies may change frequently and need to be enforced immediately.

- Testability: OPA allows you to write tests for your policies, making it easier to verify that they behave as expected before they are deployed. This can reduce errors and enhance the reliability of policy enforcement within your system.

- Auditing and Monitoring: With the ability to log policy decisions, OPA enables robust auditing and monitoring. This can assist with troubleshooting, compliance reporting, and the understanding of how policies are functioning within a system.

- Cloud-Native Compatibility: OPA is designed to work well in modern, cloud-native environments. Its compatibility with platforms like Kubernetes, and its ability to enforce policies at various levels of the stack, make it a valuable tool in these contexts.

- Interoperability: Its neutral and open standard ensures that it's not tied to any specific vendor or technology, allowing for broad adoption across different domains and technologies.

In summary, Open Policy Agent offers a powerful and flexible framework for policy enforcement that can be adapted to a wide variety of use cases. Its design encourages maintainable, testable, and auditable policy management, which is vital for modern, complex environments.

## Veloxide and Open Policy Agent

Veloxide uses an Open Policy Agent sidecar container for authorizing requests. The authentication middleware extracts any authenication information from the user's Secure Simple Token (SST), before the authorization middleware authorizes the user's request by forwarding information to the OPA sidecar. The policies themselves are stored in `/policies`, and are tested as a part of the CI/CD pipeline.
