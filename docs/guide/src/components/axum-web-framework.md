# Web Framework: Axum

Axum is a web application framework written in Rust, developed by the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) project, which is well known for building asynchronous I/O libraries in Rust.

## What is Axum?

Axum is designed to make it easy to build robust and high-performing web applications using Rust's async capabilities. It builds on top of [Tower](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower), allowing it access to a rich ecosystem.

## Key Features and Benefits

**Modularity**: Axum emphasizes modularity and promotes a functional programming style, enabling developers to compose complex applications from simple parts. It promotes the reuse of components and makes the codebase easier to maintain.

**Extensible Middleware System**: Axum allows developers to add custom middleware to modify requests and responses, providing flexibility in handling various cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, etc.

**Performance**: By building on top of high-performance libraries like Tokio and hyper and leveraging Rust's efficiency, Axum aims to provide high performance in handling web requests, achieving some of the fastest results across all languages.

## Conclusion

Axum offers an appealing option for Rust developers who want to build high-performance web applications with a strong emphasis on type safety, modularity, and extensibility. It integrates well with the broader Tokio ecosystem and benefits from Rust's efficiency and reliability.
